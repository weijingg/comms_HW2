The Mekong River is the pulsing lifeline of Southeast Asia. With almost 1,200 
unique fish species --- of which 400 are found nowhere else on Earth --- its 
rich biodiversity is rivaled only by the Amazon and the Congo. 

As the world's largest inland fishery, the Mekong accounts for more than 15% of 
global freshwater catch, supporting over 60 million locals dependent on the 
fishing industry. The Mekong Delta, known as the "rice bowl of Southeast Asia", 
contributes to 15% of global rice exports [@tri2012hydrology]. It is a vital 
agricultural region formed where the river meets the sea, home to nearly 20 
million people in the agriculture and aquaculture industry. 

Yet, the Mekong River is now clogged by a massive network of dams. Over 600 dams 
have been built or are being built across the Mekong River and its tributaries. 
Another 400 are being planned for the next decade, expanding the current network 
by 60% and pushing the total projected dam count to exceed one thousand 
[@ang2023dams].

# Hydropower generation will double

The 3,000-mile Mekong is Southeast Asia's longest river, flowing through six 
countries: China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam [@hirsch2016shifting]. 
As these nations are experiencing rapid economic and population growth, dams --- a 
relatively low-cost energy source in this water-rich region --- have proliferated 
across the Mekong River Basin in response to rising energy demands 
[@hecht2019hydropower; @IRENA]. All six countries are competing for their share 
of the river while racing to dominate the hydropower market. 

The total hydropower capacity, or the maximum power that can be generated by the 
entire dam network, had expanded exponentially from one gigawatt in the 1980s, 
to 35 gigawatts in the 2010s, and is projected to double to 70 gigawatts in the 2020s 
and beyond. 

China was the first to harness the Mekong's hydropower potential [@cronin2009mekong], 
as evidenced by its substantial expansion in hydropower capacity from the 2000s 
to the 2010s in the following graph. Having built 11 dams along the upper segment 
of the mainstream Mekong, China had become the focal point of discussions regarding the 
Mekong Basin, with many expressing concerns about the impact of upstream dams on 
reducing the water flow to downstream countries [@brianeyler]. However, the pace 
of dam construction in China is slowing as development gains momentum downstream.

# Laos as the next dam hotspot

With an ambitious goal of becoming the "Battery of Southeast Asia", Laos has the 
most planned dams and the highest expected growth in hydropower capacity of nearly 
20 gigawatts over the next decade. Laos was the third-largest exporter of 
electricity globally in 2020, with 90% imported by Thailand, and its exports are 
projected to more than triple by 2030 [@chowdhury2020expected; @obsecon]. 

As shown in the sequence of maps below, Laos' hydropower capacity is expected to 
grow significantly in the 2020s and beyond. The volume of a river's flow increases 
downstream as more rainfall is progressively captured, and Laos' strategic location 
along the lower mainstream Mekong provides key access to the greater flow volumes, 
which can be harnessed for increased hydropower [@biba2012china].

# Livelihoods and food security

While dams are viewed as an alternative energy source to depleting fossil fuels, 
the surge in dam construction has become a threat to local livelihoods and 
regional food security. Dams fragment the river and obstruct the migratory routes 
for 5 billion fishes on the move, disrupting breeding patterns and contributing 
to the concerning reality that one-fifth of the Mekong River's fish are now at 
risk of extinction [@wwf; @tang2021removing].

Dams also block nutrient-rich sediments carried by the river from reaching the 
Mekong Delta. Starving the delta of these sediments is causing it to 
shrink and lose nutrients, jeopardizing food production and the livelihoods of 
locals in the agricultural sector [@grill2014development]. 

Amidst the dam-building boom, safeguarding local communities and food security 
is crucial. However, dam planning and management in the Mekong is often haphazard 
and marred by embezzlement [@matthews2012water]. Given limited resources, it 
would be strategic to target efforts in areas of greatest concern. 

Laos' plans for seven new massive dams on the Mekong mainstream, along with 
Cambodia's plans for two, could collectively prevent up to 96% of river sediments 
from reaching the delta [@kondolf2014dams]. Future dam management efforts should 
focus on Laos, the emerging hotspot for hydropower development.
